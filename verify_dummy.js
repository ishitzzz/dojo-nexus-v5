    // To simulate API failure without breaking the server, I might need to temporarily tweak the code.

    // If I disconnect internet, it would fail.

    // Let's try to query for "Learn Rust". If API works, it returns dynamic.
    // If API fails, it returns static.

    // No, that's invasive.
